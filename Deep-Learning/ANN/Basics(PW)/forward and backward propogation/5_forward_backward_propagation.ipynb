    "# Multi-layer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to fitting more complex (*i.e.* non-linear) models with neural networks is to use a more complex network that consists of more than just a single perceptron. The take-home message from the perceptron is that all of the learning happens by adapting the synapse weights until prediction is satisfactory. Hence, a reasonable guess at how to make a perceptron more complex is to simply **add more weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to add complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add backward connections, so that output neurons feed back to input nodes, resulting in a **recurrent network**\n",
    "2. Add neurons between the input nodes and the outputs, creating an additional (\"hidden\") layer to the network, resulting in a **multi-layer perceptron**\n",

    "![multilayer](http://d.pr/i/14BS1+)\n",
    "\n",
    "How to train a multilayer network is not intuitive. Propagating the inputs forward over two layers is straightforward, since the outputs from the hidden layer can be used as inputs for the output layer. However, the process for updating the weights based on the prediction error is less clear, since it is difficult to know whether to change the weights on the input layer or on the hidden layer in order to improve the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a matter of: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. moving forward through the network, calculating outputs given inputs and current weight estimates\n",
    "2. moving backward updating weights according to the resulting error from forward propagation. \n",

    "\n",
    "Equivalently, it points *away* from the direction of maximum decrease - thus, if we start at any point, and keep moving in the direction of the negative gradient, we will eventually reach a local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple insight leads to the Gradient Descent algorithm. Outlined algorithmically, it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a point $x_0$ as your initial guess.\n",
    "2. Compute the gradient at your current guess:\n",

    "\n",
    "Its important to be aware that because gradient descent is a hill-climbing (or descending) algorithm, it is liable to be caught in local minima with respect to starting values. Therefore, it is worthwhile training several networks using a range of starting values for the weights, so that you have a better chance of discovering a globally-competitive solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful performance enhancement for the MLP learning algorithm is the addition of **momentum** to the weight updates. This is just a coefficient on the previous weight update that increases the correlation between the current weight and the weight after the next update. This is particularly useful for complex models, where falling into local minima is an issue; adding momentum will give some weight to the previous direction, making the resulting weights essentially a weighted average of the two directions. Adding momentum, along with a smaller learning rate, usually results in a more stable algorithm with quicker convergence. When we use momentum, we lose this guarantee, but this is generally seen as a small price to pay for the improvement momentum usually gives.\n",
    "\n",
    "A weight update with momentum looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_{jk} \\leftarrow w_{jk} - \\eta \\delta_k a_j + \\alpha \\Delta w_{jk}^{t-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is the momentum (regularization) parameter and $\\Delta w_{jk}^{t-1}$ the update from the previous iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-layer pereptron is implemented below in the `MLP` class. The implementation uses the scikit-learn interface, so it is uses in the same way as other supervised learning algorithms in that package."
