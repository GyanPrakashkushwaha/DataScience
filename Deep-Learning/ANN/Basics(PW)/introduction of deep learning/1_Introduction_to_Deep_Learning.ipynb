        "Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. Deep Learning is mostly about Neural Network. The main aim of Deep Learning or Neural Network is to mimic the human Brain. Means, It makes the machine learn like human being learn. To understand what deep learning is, we first need to understand the relationship deep learning has with machine learning, neural networks, and artificial intelligence. The best way to think of this relationship is to visualize them as concentric circles:\n",
