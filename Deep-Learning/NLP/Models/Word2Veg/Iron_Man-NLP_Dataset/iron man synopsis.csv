Comic name,Synopsis
Ultimate Iron Man isuue 1,"Ultimate Iron Man #1 reveals that Tony Stark's genius is the result of an accident his mother (brilliant scientist Maria Cerrera, who is the second wife of Tony Stark's father, Howard, and works for him in research and development before Tony was born) suffered while she was carrying him in her womb. The accident changed the genetic structure of both her and her unborn child, but culminated in her death during childbirth. The child, named Antonio (Tony for short), developed neural tissue normally found only in the brain all throughout his body, causing his entire body to act as one massive brain, giving him tremendous mental capacity. However, one of the side effects of the accident from the minute he was born was an extreme dermal sensitivity, making even the sensation of air on his skin feel like severe burns due to the overstimulation of neural cells in his skin. Howard Stark, a master inventor and owner and CEO of his own billion dollar tech company, used a newly invented liquid, biological armour to ease Tony's agony; a buffer allowing him to interact with the world normally, but one he would have to wear for the rest of his life. Despite the pain, he is endowed with regenerative capabilities due to the same mutation that caused the neural cells to differentiate all over his body allowing him to completely regenerate whole body parts if necessary. The biotechnology armor he wears is constructed out of genetically modified bacteria that are able to group together to dissipate kinetic energy when impacted upon, allowing the wearer to withstand tremendous blows and is able to dissolve any metal that can be oxidized. The two disadvantages of this biotech armor, which made it unmarketable, are that it can be easily neutralized by being washed off with antibacterial soap and water and, more importantly, that it will dissolve a normal human's skin after a few hours if not thoroughly washed off. This ""side effect"" worked well with Tony's regenerative capabilities, seeing as how his skin would regenerate as fast as the armor would eat it making it a perfect fit. Another secondary problem was that, initially, the liquid armor turned his skin a bright blue hue making socialization and the idea of going to a normal school more difficult."
Ultimate Iron Man isuue 2,"In Ultimate Iron Man #2, young Tony Stark is shown covered in the blue skin-armor developed by his father in issue #1. Attempting to learn how to manufacture the bio-armor, Zebediah Stane (not knowing that the armor did not work correctly for normal humans), kidnaps and tortures Tony by washing off the armor with antibacterial soap causing Tony to scream in agony when his unprotected skin hit the air."
Ultimate Iron Man isuue 3,"In issue #3, Howard arrives with a SWAT team and arrests Zebediah. During the skirmish, the toes on one of Tony's feet are severed (which, after a time, grow back due to Tony's regenerative capabilities, highlighting the extent of this ability). After the incident, a transparent version of the armor is developed, and, no longer blue, Tony begins attending a prep school. The story then fast forwards to an older Stark. His father has lost ownership of his corporation to Zebediah's now-wife Loni (who was Stark's first wife, before Maria) and they now live a middle class existence in a normal home. Tony is trying to follow in Howard's footsteps as an inventor and is developing a prototype power-armor. Not the most popular student at his school, he is constantly picked on and bullied. Seeing that he, also, is the victim of his classmates, Tony eventually befriends fellow student James Rhodes."
Ultimate Iron Man isuue 4,"Ultimate Iron Man #4 follows Tony Stark, shortly after befriending Rhodes, getting in a scuffle with bullies where they try and force Tony, feet first, into a lit furnace (having been lied to earlier that Tony would not be harmed by this action) that burns and destroys the lower half of his body and nearly leaves him dead. The altercation is interrupted by Tony's friends, causing the bullies to run away. Normally an injury like that would kill a normal human, but his friends watch, stunned, as Tony's body begins to regrow itself (and eventually regrows completely back to normal as if it never happened). Discovering that the bullies were following orders from an unknown individual, Stark's father decides, for their own protection and to put their skills to better use, to enroll Stark, Rhodes, and Nifara (another of Tony's friends), who witnessed the attack and were all of genius-level intelligence, into the Baxter Building program, a school for above genius intelligence. Also enrolled in the school is Obadiah Stane, the son of Zebediah. Shortly after their arrival, Stark witnesses Obadiah murder a pair of students and then make it look like an accident, but is unable to prove it. This incident hardens Stark's resolve to improve his armor and punish Obadiah. At this point, he has already begun to build a suit that closely resembles a traditional Iron Man suit, with Rhodes and Nifara helping him develop it."
Ultimate Iron Man isuue 5,"Ultimate Iron Man #5 shows that shortly after Howard's arrest based on planted evidence (by Obadiah) at the gruesome murder of his enemy Zebediah Stane, Tony gets his first taste of champagne at a party held by his father. Tony was warned against alcohol by his father because it would affect his brain more than a normal human due to his decentralized brain tissue and increase his chances of alcoholism. He later says that while he was intoxicated, it was the first time in his life he was not in chronic pain. After Howard's incarceration, Tony takes control of his father's company. Its at this point where two prototype variations of the suit are shown. One is roughly 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, designed for more practical testings, while the second is a large suit at least 20 feet (6.1 m) tall, for designing any additions to the traditional suit before including them to the more restricted design. The suit doesn't fly, but hovers or bounces and is not completely stable. Stark is forced to use the 20-foot (6.1 m) prototype to foil a terrorist plot to destroy his building. Though Tony is successful, the terrorists manage to detonate the bomb prematurely and completely destroy the suit. Tony is also injured, but due to his physiology, bounces back quickly."
Ultimate Iron Man volume 2,"Despite surviving being blown up in his prototype armor, Tony has other problems to address. Howard is still wrongly imprisoned for the murder of rival Zebediah Stane, and teenage Tony is forced to run Stark Enterprises in his stead. After seeing the prototype armor in use, the military wish to use the armor themselves. Convincing the military that the armors are in fact robots, both Tony and Jim Rhodes (Ultimate War Machine) suit up and go on the mission masquerading as robots. They complete the mission, and find a map that leads them to believe there are nukes in New York. Tony begins trying to find a way to release his father from jail and find out who the terrorists were that tried to blow up his building. Obadiah is working with a man named Dolores, who is responsible for the terrorist attack on the Stark building. Dolores convinces him to try to murder Howard. Obadiah drugs a prison guard with a ""hypnotizing"" bio-drug, and the guard tries to kill Howard. He fails, though Howard gets shot in the process and is in ICU. Tony sends one of his ""robots"" to protect his father in the hospital. Tony goes to Obadiahs house in the Iron Man armor and confronts him on setting up his father and sending him to prison. Obadiah says it was all Dolores' idea, and sets up a meeting with Dolores and Tony. Obadiah also figures out that the armor is not a robot, and that Tony is actually inside, a fact he shares with Dolores before he meets with Tony. Dolores and Tony make a deal. Dolores will give Tony the information about the terrorists with nukes who plan to bomb the city, and Tony will give Dolores one of his ""robots"". Tony, knowing that Dolores knows he wears the armor personally decides to trick him and actually bring an Iron Man suit that is remote controlled. Dolores and Tony meet on a place together, holding each other hostage while their friends confirm each others's end of the bargain. Dolores is skeptical because the robot isn't walking smoothly and is clumsy, and Tony is skeptical because the feds found a nuke but no terrorists with it, and the deal was for both the nuke and the terrorists. Dolores's men plan to kill the feds who delivered them the robot, but Ultimate War Machine shows up to save them. Tony then realizes that Dolores is no longer on the plane, and upon breaking into the cockpit he sees another nuke. He can't disable it, because then a separate bomb will go off, destroying the nuke and plane. War Machine goes to Dolores' mansion, only to find him dead. Someone booby trapped his piano, and it blew up in his face while he was playing. Tony flies the plane low enough to the water for Obadiah to jump off. He then gets his nanobots to disarm the nuke and set off the smaller bomb while he attempts to jump off the plane. They realize that another arms dealer was out to kill everyone (Dolores, Obadiah, and Tony). Meanwhile, Howard is recovered enough to go to prison, but the guards sent to escort him were not sent by the Police Department. He fights them off and escapes. Tony meets with him, and says that he thinks Loni, Howard's first wife and Obadiah's mother, is the mastermind behind the scenes trying to kill them. Tony, Howard, War Machine, and Obadiah set off to Utah to find Loni. They arrive and their chopper explodes, injuring War Machine. Obadiah falls off a cliff, but Iron Man catches him as terrorists arrive on the scene. Iron Man flees, but follows them as they take Obadiah to Loni, and their hideout. Iron Man breaks into the compound and Loni floods it with poison gas trying to kill him, abandoning Obadiah. Iron Man saves Obadiah, but Howard and Nifara are taken captive by Loni. After killing Nifara and the guards, (she wants no witnesses) Loni confesses that all she has ever wanted from life was power, and her only interest in men has been finding one who would help her acquire it. Howard, she laments, was smart enough to be able to conquer the world, but lacked the ambition to do so; Zebediah, her second husband, was the other way around (ambitious, but stupid); Obadiah, on the other hand, is both smart and ambitious, but unfortunately his loyalty to her can no longer be relied on. Iron Man shows up, and Loni shoots Howard in the chest, threatening to shoot him again if he doesn't take the suit off. Tony takes off his armor, and Loni shoots him in the head, not knowing of his body's self-healing capabilities. Tony fights Loni, beats her, and tends to his father. Unnoticed by anyone else, Loni reaches for a gun, but Obadiah appears, angry that his mother almost killed him with the poison gas, and kills her. However, he decides not to attack Tony, conceding that Tony had saved his life several times, but declares that they are now ""even."" Howard, Tony, and Obadiah are all picked up by federal authorities and returned home. Obadiah muses that, with his mother dead, he is finally ""free."""
Armor Wars: Stark Wars,"After Iron Man finishes a training session in order to impress a general, he returns to Stark Enterprises. Upon analyzing Force's armor, Tony discovers that the armor is based in part on his own designs, stolen before his current Iron Man armor was developed. He compiles a list of several armored criminals: Beetle, Shockwave, Doctor Doom, Stilt-Man, the Crimson Dynamo, Controller, Mauler, Professor Power, Titanium Man, the Raiders, and others. After finishing another training session, Iron Man teams up with Scott Lang to find out who stole his designs. Tony uncovers that the Spymaster was the one who sold Tony's designs to his rival Justin Hammer. Iron Man goes after the Stilt-Man, who is attempting to break into a high-rise office building. Stilt-Man is easily defeated when Iron Man chops off one of his legs and he renders the armor inoperable with a ""negator pack"" which destroys Stark circuitry within. A short time later, Iron Man battles the Controller whom he knocks unconscious in front of a crowd and negates his armor. Unable to pursue legal means to reclaim his technology, Tony plans to take out every armored warrior who is suspected of having his designs."
Armor Wars:  Glitch,"The Raiders invade an Air Force plane, drawing Iron Man's attention. Iron Man defeats the Raiders using negator packs, disabling his stolen technology. Tony finds out one name is missing from Hammer's database due to a glitch in the upload. Tony and Jim Rhodes run a search of other armor-using individuals, which prompts Tony to identify the government-sponsored Stingray as the best candidate, as other known armored heroes and villains are either not advanced enough or would not use others' designs. Tony's actions draw the West Coast Avengers' attention. Tony declines the Avengers' offer of assistance, saying that his problems are personal. Iron Man travels to the Hydro-Base, where he confronts Stingray and insists that he be allowed to test his armor for stolen circuitry. When Stingray refuses, Iron Man chases him throughout the ocean and releases electricity cybernetically to incapacitate him. He then unsuccessfully attempts to negate Stingray's armor; Stingray's armor really was not based on Stark's designs. Due to this incident, Tony is informed that the government wants Iron Man to be shut down. Reluctantly, Tony announces that Iron Man's contract has been terminated."
Armor Wars:  The Last Mandroid,"Iron Man ruthlessly attacks the Beetle as he tries to steal exotic pieces of art. Beetle attempts to escape Iron Man's wrath, but is defeated and his armor negated. Iron Man returns to his base, where he has a talk with Hawkeye. Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. meets with Tony and demands that Iron Man be handed over to him for attacking Stingray. Tony gives Fury Iron Man's file, having prepared a fake identity for Iron Man as 'Randall Pierce' in the event of such a scenario. Tony secretly intends to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Mandroid armors - which he also designed - to prevent their technology being replicated. He tells Fury that 'Pierce' has set up a hidden base in New York and suggests Fury dispatch the Mandroids to bring Iron Man in. Tony, as Iron Man, engages the Mandroids and disables all five, much to Fury's dismay. Tony fakes evidence to suggest that Iron Man knew about their plan because he planted a bug in their equipment. Later, Tony arranges to create a new shield for Captain America."
Armor Wars:  Who Guards the Guardsmen?,"The Captain (which was an alias Rogers used after abandoning the Captain America persona at the time) thanks Tony for the new shield. Meanwhile, the villain Electro is defeated by the Guardsmen and is imprisoned at the Vault, though it was Rhodes who disguised himself as Electro to sneak into the Vault. Iron Man sneaks into the Vault to neutralize the Guardsmen- as with the Mandroids, he seeks to prevent others replicating their technology- but he is caught by two Guardsmen. Rhodes accidentally breaks out all the prisoners at the Vault after he tricks a Guardsman who spotted him earlier. While battling a Guardsman, Iron Man catches the attention of the Captain. Rogers agreed with Tony's motives, but calls his methods reckless and dangerous. While trying to save a Guardsman from dying, Iron Man violently knocks him out, rendering the Captain in a coma."
Armor Wars:  Red Snow,"The West Coast Avengers arrives at Tony's home, where they try to make Tony explain himself. Tony tells them he found out about the armor being stolen after analyzing Force's armor. The West Coast Avengers are hesitant to tell Tony that he is off the team after he leaves. Crimson Dynamo and Titanium Man meet with the President, who tells them to defend the people of Russia after revealing that Iron Man is going to Russia, but Titanium Man disagrees saying that Iron Man is too dangerous for anybody to handle, preferring to remain in hiding. Tony invents a modified version of the Stealth armor to sneak into Russia undetected. Iron Man goes after Titanium Man, but he fought back. While Iron Man was distracted by the Crimson Dynamo, the Titanium Man's pilot Kondrati Topolov dons the armor and leads a double assault on Iron Man. Iron Man defeats the Crimson Dynamo and negates his armor. Distracted, Iron Man is attacked and overwhelmed by Titanium Man. Iron Man tries to escape, but Titanium Man grabs him. Iron Man flies up to space to try to shake Titanium Man off of him. However, Titanium Man's armor overheated, setting him on fire. The Titanium Man armor explodes, killing the pilot. Enraged, the Russian soldiers try to attack Iron Man, but he escapes. Back at the West Coast Avengers Mansion, Hawkeye states that Iron Man is stripped of his membership as a West Coast Avenger."
Armor Wars:  The Day the Hero Died,"Test pilot Jack Taggert demonstrates a flight simulator to the U.S. Government. Edwin Cord, Tony's rival, tells a general to jumpstart the plan that can defeat Iron Man once and for all. Later, Jack suits up as Firepower to demonstrate the armor's power. Later that day, Firepower lures Iron Man into a trap, Iron Man having identified Firepower as the result of the name missing from Hammer's list. Iron Man blasts Firepower, but he strikes back. Iron Man struggles to fight Firepower due to his superior weaponry. In the nick of time, Iron Man escapes Firepower's wrath with the help of Rhodes. Unfortunately, Iron Man leads a final assault on Firepower. In retaliation, Firepower launches a nuclear missile at Iron Man, seemingly killing Iron Man in the process."
Armor Wars:  Reborn Again,"It is revealed that Tony survived the explosion, but with severe injuries. Rhodes attempts to tell Tony to fight back as Iron Man, but Tony refused saying that the world got their wish and feeling that it is too dangerous to create new armor. Elsewhere, the U.S. Government tries to tell Cord to hand over Firepower, but Cord declined stating that he's not done with Firepower yet and blackmails them by threatening to discredit them by leaking their plans about using Firepower as a means of crowd control to the public should they try any form of legal action against him. Firepower destroys several of Stark related tech, which led Tony to believe that Firepower is behind all this. At the same time, Firepower destroys a truck full of Stark tech, surprising Tony. Firepower reveals to Tony that Cord wants revenge on both Tony and Iron Man for destroying Cord Conglomerate.[a] Angry, Tony invents another version of the Iron Man armor to combat Firepower. Days later, Firepower attacks Stark Enterprises' San Francisco bureau only to face off against the ""new"" Iron Man. After a lengthy battle, Iron Man defeats Firepower, but during the fight, Iron Man damaged Firepower's backpack, which was carrying a neutron bomb. Iron Man deceives Firepower into disabling the bomb by claiming that he cannot ""rescue"" him from his armor in time. However, he reveals the ruse immediately after by tearing Jack out of the armor. Angered by the deception, Firepower claims that Starks ""new"" bodyguard is nothing like the ""other"" Iron Man. That night, reflecting that he will continue as Iron Man due to the dangers that only Iron Man can handle, Tony was glad he could get a good night's sleep, and he falls asleep, ending the story."
The Mask In The Iron Man,"While flying under the radar for many fans, this 5-issue miniseries saw the armor of Tony Stark become sentient after an encounter with the villain Whiplash left the armor damaged and malfunctioning. Falling in line with Y2k hysteria off the late 90s, Tony theorizes the lack of security measures against the bug melded the lighting strike with the advanced technology to manifest a self-aware AI. Wanting to become one with Tony, the armor would strand Tony on a remote island until he agreed to give in to the armor's wishes though upon return of an Avengers distress call Tony would overtake the armor, revealing a partial synthetic flesh being graphed showing the intent to replace Tony. After experiencing a heart attack, the armor would sacrifice itself to save Tony."
Deliverance,"Written by Dennis O'Neil in 1984, this rather bleak story saw Tony Stark hit rock bottom with his alcohol addiction. Becoming a homeless man, he'd be accompanied by a pregnant woman named Gretel who'd give birth in an abandoned warehouse and would perish in the ensuing birth of her child, however, the baby survives. Before almost freezing to death, his best friend James Rhodes, who had taken over the mantle of Iron Man for a brief stint, came to the aid of Tony and finally helped him kick his alcohol addiction."
Extremis,"A pivotal story in the Iron Man mythos, Extremis was another attempt for the U.S. government to recreate the super-soldier serum and would see the development of nanite technology that enhanced various attributes of its user. From enhanced speed and strength to a healing factor and even fire breathing, the Extremis virus granted many of the same abilities that were seen in 2013's Iron Man 3, which was loosely based on the Extremis storyline."
Doomquest,"Written by David Michelinie, the two-issue story arc pits Marvel's titular engineers against one another after an illegal sale of Stark tech compels Tony to retrieve the shipment. Becoming aware the sale was made to Dr. Doom of Latveria, Tony is forced to engage in an altercation with Doom after Doom refused to return the tech. In the midst of there fight Doom's spiteful henchman, Hauptmann sends them back to the era of Camelot using Doom's Time Platform. The resolution in the follow up would have the two strike a truce after Tony defeats an allied Morgan Le Fey and her forces, using each other's armors to construct a basic time machine to get back to the present."
Iron Monger Saga,"The saga that would initiate something greater than itself, the Iron Monger saga would see Tony's business rival Obidiah Stane undermine Tony and his reputation, causing Tony to relinquish the Iron Man mantle to his best friend Rhodey, and relapsing back into alcoholism and even homelessness. Though not a tit-for-tat in translation, the story arc would be the birth of the MCU with 2008's Iron Man adapting the elaborate story to the silver screen. Tony completely falling off the wagon was justly an attribute left out and simply something grazed over, though the Silver Centurian would've been a great homage to the epic showdown between the two business tycoons.

"
Superior Iron Man,"Following the events of Axis, an event that saw a magical spell invert the morality of villains and heroes alike, Tony shields himself presiding the spells disbandment, leaving the darkest qualities of himself to become a full-fledged, self-serving villain. He'd go on to develop and publicly release the new and improved Extremis 3.0, a wireless application that made its user physically appealing to all who saw them, however, Tony's dubious caveat of paying $100/day after the free trial period puts him at odds with Daredevil, Pepper Potts, and even a memory of Tony in the form of artificial intelligence."
Iron Man 2020,"Presiding Tony Stark's death in Civil War 2, a reconstructed artificial AI of his conscience would be uploaded into a cloned body. Ideally, he would continue on his escapades as Iron Man though in truth it would be his brother, Arno Stark, who would take stead of his adoptive brother's mantle as the Golden Avenger. While the story itself is still being fully fleshed out, we see Arno, who shares no love loss to the ""human potential"" robots and AI could achieve, believing them to be less than human and therefore not afforded the same rights as natural-born sentience. This opinionated skewed bigotry results in pitting Tony and an army of robots against his brother."
Infamous Iron Man,"Tony's brother Arno Stark wouldn't be the only one who'd assume the position as Iron Man in Marvel Comics. In his physical absence, a reformed Victor Von Doom seeking redemption would usurp the mantle as a new, Infamous Iron Man, well before Arno would in 2020. Following the events of Johnathan Hickman's 2015 Secret Wars, Victor would have a paradigm shift in thought, seeing as his countless escapades of attaining godhood fell short due to his villainy, he believed he should seek his goals through a more benevolent approach. Written by Brian Michael Bendis, the character development on behalf of Doom is astounding, making the Iron Man infused story all the better."
Demon in a battle,"Now there are a lot of stories in the Iron Man mythos that make the character a truly interesting one to read about, but David Michelinie's and Bob Layton's Demon in a Bottle stands the test of time as one the most consequential Iron Man stories, seeing Tony's alcoholism being brought to the forefront as a serious problem. The story would serve as a backdrop more or less to multiple tales regarding Tony almost relapsing into his weaker self, though it would be this 1979 issue that would show a more human, though desperate, side of Tony battling his alcohol addiction."
