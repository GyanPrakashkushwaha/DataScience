SPARR: Here's something a bit more interesting.
It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.
A man drank one of those guarana sodas.
Guess it had a little more kick than he was looking for.
Wow.
- Where was it bottled? - Porto Verde, Brazil.
Have our people look for a white man at the bottling plant.
Tell them no contact! If he even sees them, he's gone!
I got you who I could. Short notice, but they're all quality.
And I pulled you one ace.
Emil Blonsky. Born in Russia, raised in England.
And on loan to SOCOM from the Royal Marines.
GENERAL: I know you cashed in some chips for this, Joe.
Glad I could help. Just make it good.
SPARR: This is the target and the location. Snatch and grab, live capture.
You'll have your dart clips and suppression ordnance,
but live fire is for backup only.
We got local out there, but we want it tight and quiet.
Is he a fighter?
Your target is a fugitive from the US government
who stole military secrets.
He is also implicated in the deaths of two scientists,
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper and possibly two Canadian hunters.
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!
Tranq him and bring him back.

I knew something was different before I got the shot off.
He had it on him when he bolted.
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?
She is no longer a factor.
We closed that door to him a long time ago. He's alone.
He wants to be alone. But see if he's been talking to anybody.
Forgive me, sir?
Doesn't anybody want to talk about what went down in there? 'Cause...
He didn't lose us.
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.
And then something hit us, something...
Something big hit us!
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!
It was the most powerful thing I've ever seen.
Well, it's gone.
Well, if Banner knows what it is,
I'm gonna track him down, I'm gonna put my foot on his throat
- and I'm gonna... - That was Banner.
It
was Banner.
- You have to explain that statement, sir. - No, I don't.
You've done a good job.
Pack up and get our men on a plane. We're going home.
Wait.
Please.
(IN ENGLISH) Where am I?
BLONSKY: I've run into bad situations on crap missions before.
I've seen good men go down
purely because someone didn't let us know what we were walking into.
I've moved on to the next one, because that's what we do, right?
I mean, that's the job.
But this?
This is a whole new level of weird.
And I don't feel inclined to step away from it.
So if you're taking another crack at him, I want in.
And, with respect, you should be looking for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,
because if that thing shows up again,
you're gonna have a lot of professional tough guys pissing in their pants.

(MOTORCYCLE PASSING)
Let me emphasise that what I'm about to share with you
is tremendously sensitive, both to me personally and the Army.
You're aware that we've got an Infantry Weapons Development programme.
Well, in WWll, they initiated a subprogram
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.
Yeah, Super Soldier.
Yes.
An oversimplification, but yes.
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing serious work again, bold work.
Across the hall, they were trying to arm you better.
We were tryin' to make you better.
Banner's work was very early phase. It wasn't even weapons application.
He thought he was working on radiation resistance.
I would never have told him what the project really was.
But he was so sure of what he was onto, that he tested it on himself.
And something went very wrong.
Or it went very right.
As far as I'm concerned, that man's whole body is the property of the US Army.
You said he wasn't working on weapons, right?
- No. - But you were. You were, weren't you?
You were trying other things.
One serum we developed
was very promising.
- So why did he run? - He's a scientist.
He is not one of us.
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45? - 39.
- It takes a toll, doesn't it? - Yes, it does.
So get out of the trenches.
You should be a Colonel by now, with your record.
No, I'm a fighter. I'll be one for as long as I can.
You know, if I could take what I know now, put it in the body I had ten years ago,
that would be someone I wouldn't want to fight.
I could probably arrange something like that.
Take care, kids.
Stan, I give you my word,
whatever you've heard about me, it's not true.
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.
- Have you talked to her? - No.
She doesn't know that I'm here.
- She's with somebody? - Yeah, he's a head shrink.
They say he's one of the best. But a really nice guy.
Good. That's good.
- Bruce, what can I do to help you? - I could use a bed for a few nights.
- You can have the spare room upstairs. - That'd be so great.
There is one other thing.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through.
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.
I don't think there's anybody up there.
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell if I don't collect. You got to let me try.
I'll tell you what. I got an extra medium. Take it on the house.
- You are the man. - God bless you, brother.
All right.
(COMPUTERS BLEEPING)
Okay.
We're pretty well closed here, folks. I'm sorry.
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.
Oh, kids.
I got nothing but marinara now.
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.
She worked through dinner again, of course.
Stan?
And he... I go, "So, yeah, I mean, where were you?
"I can't... I don't know where you were, Cecil."
And he goes, "Not where you been at."
I thought, "Oh, my God." I just felt so awful.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Bruce?
Betty? What's going on?
Betty...
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.
- I don't know what to say. - Please, just tell me the truth.
BETTY: Don't go. Don't go.
I want you to come with me now.
Please. Come with me.
Please.
BETTY: It's our data.
I got in there before they carted it all away.
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us something someday.
- Does the General know that you have this? - No, I don't think so.
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.
You have to be sure.
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't just go in there together and talk to him.
He told me what he wanted to do. He wants it out of me.
He wants to dissect it so that he can replicate it.
He wants to make it a weapon.
- Hi. - Hi.
- I thought you might want to... - Thanks.
Listen, I should leave early, as early as I can.
Really? You can't stay at all?
I want to, but it's just not safe for me to be here.
- Lf I could borrow some cash... - Of course.
I need to take a bus.
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.
Okay.
- You have everything you need? - Yeah.
I...
What?
- Good night. - Good night.
I hope you get some rest.
We're giving you a very low dose only.
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.
First sign of any side effect,
we stop and you're off team until you straighten out.
- Agreed? - Agreed.
You'll get two separate infusions.
One into the deep muscle, one into the bone marrow centres.
The bone ones are going to hurt.
(GRUNTS)
Is everything okay?
I think so.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

- I just wanna do this. - Oh.
- It's better like that. - Yeah?
It feels too tight, huh?
- Yeah, a little. - Okay.

- Betty, look at me, look at me! - Bruce!
You have to go far away from me as you can!
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go! - Bruce!
(CAR ALARM SOUNDING)

I wanna know who jumped the gun.

I got him!
Stop! Stop!

I need to know where they're going.
She'll be in incredible danger as long as she's with him.
From who?
He protected her. You almost killed her.
I give you my word, her safety is my main concern at this point.
You know, it's a point of professional pride with me
that I can always tell when somebody's lying.
And you are.
I don't know where he's going.
- I know she'll help him, if she can. - Then she's aiding a fugitive.
And I can't help either one of them.
I used to wonder why she never talked about you.
Now I know!

Wow.
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection, but I got you some options.
First thing's first.
Oh, you're kidding me.

I'll take my chances.
FEMALE REPORTER: Rumours continue to swirl about a violent clash
between forces of the US military and an unknown adversary
on the campus of Culver University earlier today.
Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson witnessed some of the battle.
JIM: It was so big.
- It was like this huge, like, hulk! - Yeah.
FEMALE REPORTER: McGhee, who happens to be a reporter for the campus paper,
captured this on his cell phone.
Further search for the mysterious "hulk"
was postponed by powerful thunderstorms in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.

- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier. - Thank you, sir.
How do you feel?
Pissed off and ready for round three.
Basically, we can't use any of this, because they can track all of it.
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?
- No. You can take your lip gloss. - Thank you.
- Well, I need my glasses. - Well, you can take
- your glasses and your watch, okay? - Okay.
We can use most of it. We just can't use the credit cards, the ID or the phone.
- Don't even turn that on. - Okay.
And we'll take the cash, obviously.
How will we get where we need to go on $40 and no credit cards?
Well, we could sell this.
No. No, that's the only thing you have left from her. No.

He made it five years and got across borders without making any mistakes.
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

He's not trying to escape this time.
He's looking for help and that's how we're gonna get him.

- Do you remember anything? - Just fragments. Images.
There's too much noise. I can never derive anything out of it.
- But then it's still you inside it. - No. No, it's not.
I don't know. In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.
Maybe your mind is in there,
it's just overcharged and can't process what's happening.
I don't want to control it. I want to get rid of it.
Are you ready?

Oh! Dr Ross!
- I have someone who'd like to meet you. - Okay.
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?
Mr Green?
I got to tell you, I've been wondering if you were even real.
And if you were, what would it look like?
A person with that much power lurking in him.
Nothing could have surprised me more
than this unassuming man shaking my hand.
But, look. We're not strolling into the park for a picnic, here.
Even if everything goes perfectly,
if we induce an episode, if we get the dosage exactly right,
is that going to be a lasting cure
or just some antidote to suppress that specific flare-up?
I don't know.
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this by even the smallest integer
we're dealing with concentrations with extraordinary levels of toxicity.
- You mean it could kill him. - Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.
You should know that there's a flip side to this, too.
If we miss on the low side, if we induce me and it fails,
this will be very dangerous for you.
Look. I've always been more curious than cautious,
and that's served me pretty well. So, are we going to do this?
How you feeling, man?
Like a monster.
Okay. On the table.
These will protect you from yourself if you have a strong reaction.
You can tell me later if you thought it was strong.
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.
Okay...
You, you, you.
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.
(MACHINE STARTING UP)
We have begun.
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote with your blood.
Except the antidote will only take hold once we've achieved a full reaction.

Hi.
Hi.
That was the most extraordinary thing I have seen in my entire life!
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.
We need to go back and talk about what just happened in there.
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse came from the amygdala.
- I think Dr Ross's primer... - Are you okay?
...lets the cells absorb the energy temporarily, and then it abates.
That's why you didn't die of radiation sickness years ago!
Now, maybe we've neutralised those cells permanently,
or maybe we just suppressed that event.
I'm inclined to think the latter, but it's hard to know
because none of our test subjects ever survived.
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer! - Wait, wait.
- Wait, what did you just say? - They weren't getting
- the myostatin primer... - No, no, no. Test subjects?
What test subjects?
Come with me.
- SPARR: What's the activity level? - Snipers are covering Alpha sector.
STERNS ON RADIO: We started on rats and mice,
but it just completely fried them, so we had to go bigger.
And we still don't know which is more toxic, the gamma or your blood.
- What do you mean, my blood? - Bruce, this is all you.
You didn't send me much to work with, so I had to concentrate it and make more.
With a little more trial and error, there's no end to what we can do!
This is potentially Olympian!
This gamma technology has limitless applications.
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.
We will make humans impervious to disease!
No, no, we've got to destroy it.
- Wait, what? - All of it.
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.
- Is this the whole supply? - What...
We could get the Nobel for this!
You don't understand the power of this thing.
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.
At your discretion, shooter.

He's a fugitive.
You made him a fugitive
to cover your failures and to protect your career.
Don't ever speak to me as your daughter again.
It's only because you're my daughter that you're not in handcuffs, too.
SPARR: Are you telling me you can make more like him?
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces, but it's not like I can put together
the same Humpty Dumpty, if that's what you're asking.
He was a freak accident! The goal is to do it better!
So Banner's the only...
- She's an annoying bitch. - Why are you always hitting people?
Now what possibly could I have done to deserve such aggression?
It's not what you've done. It's what you're gonna do.
I want what you got out of Banner. I want that.
You look like you've got a little something in you already, don't you?
I want more. You've seen what he becomes, right?
I have.
And it's beautiful.

Well, I want that.
I need that. Make me that.
I don't know what you've got inside you already.

121st Street, heading north on Broadway!
Turn us around.
We're going back. Why are we going back?
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!
Yes, sir!
What the hell was that?
Go, go, go!
(SIRENS WAILING)
No!
(WOMAN SCREAMING)
(GROWLING)
One of yours?
Oh, my God. What have you done?
OFFICER: Fire at him, fire at him!
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?
Come on!
Sweet.
(ABOMINATION ROARING)
Booyah!
(LAUGHING)
(CAR ALARMS BEEPING)
Get out of there, soldier!
Stacy!
Give me a real fight!
Sir?
Sir?
Tell them to bring everything they've got and head for Harlem.
It has to be me. You have to take me back there.
What are you saying?
You think you can control it?
No, no, not control it, but, I don't know, maybe aim it.
And what if you can't?
We made this thing.
All of us.
Please.
- Land us near it. - No, no. No, keep us high.
Open the back door.
Bruce! Bruce, stop! Stop! What are you doing?
Think about this! You don't even know if you'll change!
You don't have to do this! Please, this is insane!
Betty, I've got to try.
I'm sorry.
Oh, shit!
- Get her in here! - Come on, miss.
(HULK GROWLING)
There. Betty!
(PEOPLE CLAMOURING)
(ROARING)
Hulk!
Yeah!
(BOTH GROWLING)
(ABOMINATION LAUGHING)
Come on!
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO)
(ROARING)
Is that all you've got?
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!
Which one?
Help the green one, damn it! Which one do you think?
Cut the other one in half!
Ross!
Keep it on him!
(HULK AND ABOMINATION GRUNTING)
PILOT: Look, I got to put it down! GENERAL: Hang on!
(ALARM SOUNDING)
(ABOMINATION AND HULK GRUNTING)
Dad?
(GROANING)
Are you hurt? Let me help you.
I'm all right. Just find a way out.
(GROWLING)
(CHUCKLING)
You don't deserve this power! Now watch her die!
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Look out!
General?
Any last words?
Hulk smash!
(ROARING)
BETTY: Stop!
(ROARING)
It's okay.
Betty.
(GROWLING)
(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)
(HEART BEATING)
(HEART BEATING RAPIDLY)
GENERAL: Reload.
Reload.
TONY: The smell of stale beer and defeat.
You know, I hate to say, "I told you so," General,
but that Super Soldier programme was put on ice for a reason.
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.
- Stark. - General.
You always wear such nice suits.
Touche.
- I hear you have an unusual problem. - You should talk.
You should listen.
What if I told you we were putting a team together?
Who's "we"?
